## Beat Em Up Game
### (With RPG elements?)
#### (And Co-Op!)

[Download binary](../../releases/)

Controls:

`z` (to jump)

`x` (to punch, not very well.)

`c` (to punch, better.)

`arrow keys` (to move; double tap horizontally to run)

`shift` (to block)

or, plug in a gamepad. If you plug in multiple then you can play co-op.

Here's a screenshot I guess. Currently using tons of open gameart sprites.
